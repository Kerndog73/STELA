What would you use the blank identifier _ for?

Unused function parameters. Maybe you're conforming to an interface and
you need a parameter to satisfy the interface but you don't need to use it.

An interface defines the interface of a generic type. A generic function says
"I accept types that implement this interface" so whenever you try to call a
function with a type, the compiler will check if the type satisfies the
interface. The compiler will also check if the function uses the interface
correctly. This might be easier to implement than C++ style generics.
