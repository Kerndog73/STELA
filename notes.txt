A type trait checks for functions that are defined for a particular type.
A Hashable trait might be implemented like this:

trait Hashable<T> {
  func hash(cref T) -> uint;
};

This says that a type T is Hashable if there exists a hash function that takes
a cref to T and returns an uint.

We could allow for binary traits this

trait SwappableWith<T, U> {
  func swap(ref T, ref U);
};

I'm not sure if there is any use for binary traits.

Traits can be composed. You might want your hashable type to be comparable.

trait Hashable<T> {
  func hash(cref T) -> uint;
  trait EqualityComparable;
};

Maybe you want a function to find the index of an element in a hash table
You might do something like this:

func hashIndex<Key: Hashable>(key: cref Key, size: uint) {
  return hash(key) % size;
}

You cannot pass this function an object that doesn't have the Hashable trait.
This function only knows that the key is Hashable so it cannot assume that
the type has any other traits. For example,

func hashIndexInt<Key: Integral>(key: Key, size: uint) {
  return (make uint key) % size;
}
func hashIndex<Key: Hashable>(key: cref Key, size: uint) {
  // this is invalid even if hashIndex is called with an integer
  return hashIndexUint(key, size);
}

The traits required by hashIndexInt would have to be a subset of Hashable for
this to work. Using traits instead of the C++ way templates work (duck typing)
means that a generic function doesn't need to be type checked every time it is
instantiated.

You could use a function to tag a type and detect the function in the trait.

type T struct {};

func myCoolTag(T) {}

trait HasCoolTag<T> {
  func myCoolTag(T);
};

These tags could be used to describe a type. Since the functions are never,
actually called, they will be omitted from the executable.

Need some way of associating a type with another type.

type A struct {
  first: sint;
};
type B struct {
  first: real;
};

type FirstType<type A> = sint;
type FirstType<type B> = real;

Template specialization. This needs to be a part of traits somehow.
We need some way of referencing the associated type in the trait.
How do Rust and Swift do this?

Maybe...

assoc type FirstType{A} = sint;
assoc type FirstType{B} = real;

assoc let FirstTypeName{A} = "sint";
assoc let FirstTypeName{B} = "real";

trait HasFirst{T} {
  type FirstType{T};
  let FirstTypeName{T};
};

func getFirstName{T: HasFirst}() {
  // access associated let
  return FirstTypeName{T};
}

// access associated type in parametized type alias
type FT{T: HasFirst} = FirstType{T};

Maybe have a look at one of the Go generics proposals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An interface defines the interface of a generic type. A generic function says
"I accept types that implement this interface" so whenever you try to call a
function with a type, the compiler will check if the type satisfies the
interface. The compiler will also check if the function uses the interface
correctly. This might be easier to implement than C++ style generics.

interface Ordered {
  func lt(Self) -> bool;
};

func min<T: Ordered>(vals: [T]) -> T {
  if (size(vals) == 0u) {
    return make T {};
  }
  var elem = vals[0];
  for (i := 1u; i != size(vals); i++) {
    if (val[i].lt(elem)) {
      elem = val[i];
    }
  }
  return elem;
}

func swap<T>(a: ref T, b ref T) {
  let temp = a;
  a = b;
  b = temp;
}

In provide functions for working with arrays, we're going to need some kind
of generics.

func capacity<T>(arr: [T]) -> uint;
func size<T>(arr: [T]) -> uint;
func push_back<T>(arr: ref [T], elem: T);
func append<T>(arr: ref [T], other: [T]);
func pop_back<T>(arr: ref [T]);
func resize<T>(arr: ref [T], size: uint);
func reserve<T>(arr: ref [T], size: uint);

We don't need generic types (only generic functions) to deal with arrays.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A closure is a pointer to a function and a reference counted pointer to captured
variables.

struct Closure {
  Function *func;
  retain_ptr<Data> data;
};

The reference counted pointer makes the closure a reference type.

A closure behaves very similarly to an entt::delegate except that the a pointer
to captured variables is stored instead of an instance pointer.

entt::delegate required wrapper functions but this implementation will not
require them.

Every function is actually a member function. So called "non-member functions"
accept a "this pointer" but simply ignore it. This means that a regular function
can be stored in a closure and it will ignore the nullptr to the captured data.
A capturing lambda function will accept the pointer to the captured data and
use it.

A closure is implemented in the same way that dynamic go-style interfaces
would be implemented except that the closure holds a single function pointer
where an interface would store a pointer to a table of function pointers that
make up the implementation of the interface. If we have one, do we really need
the other?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Iterators know when they have reached their end
  A pseudo random number generator could have an interface like an iterator
  This would allow you to do something like std::copy to fill an array with
  random numbers.

  An array iterator will store two pointers. This means that algorithms don't
  need to take two iterators.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

trait RandomAccessIterator<T> {
  type value_type;
  func next(cref T) -> T;
  func next(cref T, sint) -> T;
  func prev(cref T) -> T;
  func prev(cref T, sint) -> T;
  func good(cref T) -> bool;
  func size(cref T) -> sint;
  func get(ref T) -> value_type<T>;
  func set(cref T, cref value_type<T>);
}

trait RandomAccessRange<T> {
  type iterator: RandomAccessIterator;
  func iter(T) -> iterator<T>;
}

for (i := iter(array); good(i); i = next(i)) {

}

for i in array.iter() {

}

trait InputIterator<T> {
  type value_type;
  func next(cref T) -> T;
  func good(cref T) -> bool;
  func get(ref T) -> value_type<T>;
}

struct MTrand {
  curr: uint;
};

assoc type value_type<MTrand> = uint;

func next(gen: MTrand) {
  return make MTrand {gen.curr * 786784};
}

func good(gen: MTrand) {
  return true;
}

func get(gen: MTrand) {
  return gen.curr;
}

impl InputIterator MTrand;

var array: [uint];
resize(array, 1000);
copy(make MTrand {16}, array);

push_back iterator?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A trait contains a list of:
  other traits
  function signatures
  associated types (possibly constrained)

functions can be declared
types can be associated with other types

generic functions have template parameters that are constrained
these template parameters can be deduced from the function call

generic types have template parameters that are constained
deducing template parameters might be tricky

the user can assert that a type satisfies a trait

associating a type is different to specializing a generic type
  specializing a generic type requires that the generic type is already declared
  it might be possible for a trait to required a type specialzation which
  requires the same trait so the two must be separate.

the compiler must determine
  when a type satisfies a trait
  whether the usage of a generic parameter matches the trait
  whether a trait is a subset of another (when a generic function calls another
  generic function)

think about the rules for function overloading and shadowing. Overload across modules?
should mutability be part of the type system properly? What we have now just lets use make variables constant
deal with user types void *

deduce the type of InitList in all places that C++ can
a closure can capture the array that contains it
if closure creates wrapper functions for storing function pointers,
  the wrapped function will be inlined and calls directly to the wrapped

  can we inline a particular function call?
use memcmp when possible
optimize for trivially copyable structs that fit in registers
treat the return parameter as an lvalue (NRVO)
maybe ast::Type uniquing?
maybe we shouldn't inline so aggressively
swap operator? :=:
expose reference counted pointers
arrays should be value types
cref
  maybe cref could be a little smarter than const &
  for generic programming, it would be really handy if cref sint just passed
  sint by value.
  cref can bind to an rvalue like it can in C++

separate function signature from functions, lambdas and function types
  there are a lot of functions that only need to know the function signature
  but actually take sym::FuncParams or ast::Func.
  This is a mess!
consistent naming
  Type -> Ty

is ptr_union a good idea?
  we can remove a few dynamic casts
  malloc returns a pointer with alignment of std::max_align_t

range for loops might speed up iteration
