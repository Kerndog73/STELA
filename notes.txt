We cannot infer the type of an empty array literal. An empty array literal can
be converted to a an empty int array or an empty bool array. When determining
the type of an expression, we need to know the expected type (if there is one).

var arr: [sint] = [];

When determining the type of [], we need to know the type [sint]. We can check
that [sint] is an array type and we know that [] is an empty array so we return
[sint].
