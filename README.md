# Statically Typed Embeddable LAnguage

## File Extension
`.stela` or `.ste` (if the filesystem limits extensions to three characters).

## Goals
This language was designed to be fast, minimal and easy to embed in a C++ application.

## Influence
Much of the syntax was influenced by Swift but **this is not a subset of Swift**.
